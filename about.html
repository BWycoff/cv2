    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I thrive in a workplace with constant challenges and varied projects. I throw myself into research and discovery, immersing myself into the details to find threads to pull out and combine into something tangible with texture and depth. This is the foundation for every project, and I believe this base should be strong and solid before building on top of it. I love getting down to the core of every design question: what is it that will connect people to the brand, and how do we expand this idea into a full story?</p>
    <p>The path I took to becoming a graphic designer was not traditional. I have found that my perspective on how things work, are perceived, can be combined, and what is possible, is unique. I find solutions that may not be seen by other designers. I pull from every aspect of my experience of being a human, from every industry, every job type with any subject matter, every visual, every sound, every conversation, and create something that makes people stop, look longer, and think.</p>
    <p>I am excited about branding + identity work, ad design, design strategy, redesigns, publication design, print design, environment design, + package design.</p>
